title: GPS Lock
---

GPS Lock is an amalgam of UNIX pthread library and Global Positioning System (GPS). This GPS Lock provides location-based synchronization in which it is used to block on a location-based condition variable. There are three main functionalities that a GPS Lock supports: gps_lock, gps_unlock, and gps_wait. Similar to the pthread library, GPS Lock requires an explicit lock and unlock. Hence, it is user's responsibility to prevent any synchronization problem such as deadlock and data race. Unlike the pthread library, GPS Lock has an implicit signal/broadcast mechanism. As soon as the device is within proximity of the specified location, all sleeping threads that are waiting on this lock will be awakened.

The GPS Lock takes three parameters: latitude, longitude, and radius. Both latitude and longitude are expressed in E6 format in order to be consistent with Google Maps API. This geo-position will determine where the location event will be raised. The proximity of the location is specified by the radius of which is measured in meters.
